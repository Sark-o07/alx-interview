# 0x07. Rotate 2D Matrix

## Description

This directory contains Python code to rotate a 2D square matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place. The main function `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` takes a 2D square matrix as input and rotates it 90 degrees clockwise in place.

## Files

- `0-rotate_2d_matrix.py`: Contains the implementation of the `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` function, which rotates a 2D square matrix 90 degrees clockwise in place.

## Usage

To use the `rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)` function, import it into your Python script or interactive session. Pass a 2D square matrix as an argument to the function, and it will rotate the matrix in place.

Example:

```python
from rotate_2d_matrix import rotate_2d_matrix

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

rotate_2d_matrix(matrix)

print(matrix)
```

Output:
```
[
    [7, 4, 1],
    [8, 5, 2],
    [9, 6, 3]
]
```
