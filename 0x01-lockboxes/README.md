## Lockboxes

### Description
You are tasked with solving the "Lockboxes" problem. You have a collection of locked boxes numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1, where each box may contain keys to other boxes. Your objective is to write a method that determines if it's possible to unlock all the boxes.

### Problem Statement
You are given a list of lists called `boxes`, where each inner list represents a box. The index of each inner list corresponds to the box number, starting from 0. A key with the same number as a box can unlock that box.

### Input
- `boxes`: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a box and may contain keys to other boxes.

### Constraints
- All keys are positive integers.
- Some keys may not have corresponding boxes.
- The first box `boxes[0]` is already unlocked.

### Output
- Return `True` if all boxes can be opened.
- Return `False` if there's at least one box that cannot be opened.

### Function Signature
```python
def canUnlockAll(boxes: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    pass
```

### Example
```python
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
assert canUnlockAll(boxes) == True

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
assert canUnlockAll(boxes) == True

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
assert canUnlockAll(boxes) == False
```

### Note
The function should determine whether all boxes can be opened, considering the keys available in each box and the relationships between keys and boxes.
